Building from source is fairly simple, if you have all of the following:

 - Basic system development libraries, plus a C toolchaini
   ("apt-get install build-essential" on Debian-based distributions)
 - The libhidapi-hidraw libraries, plus development headers
   ("apt-get install libhidapi-dev" on Debian-based distributions)
 - pkg-config ("apt-get install pkg-config" on Debian-based distributions)
 - Enough of the Linux kernel source to build out-of-tree modules
   ("apt-get install linux-headers-generic" on Ubuntu)

Once everything is in place, you can run "make" to build everything, then
run "make install" to install everything.  There are certain variables you
can set (PREFIX, CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS, KDIR, DESTDIR) to customize install
locations, kernel source tree selection, and build options.  So far this
has been tested on Ubuntu 15.04 amd64, but I know of no reason it shouldn't
work on other distributions.
