Building from source is fairly simple, if you have all of the following:

 - Basic system development libraries, plus a C toolchain ("apt-get install
   build-essential" on Debian-based distributions)
 - The libhidapi-hidraw libraries, plus development headers ("apt-get install
   libhidapi-dev" on Debian-based distributions)
 - pkg-config ("apt-get install pkg-config" on Debian-based distributions)

Afterwards, just type "make".  Currently all it does is build zdpms-config,
which you can run in place and/or copy to a system path.
