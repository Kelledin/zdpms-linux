Enermax ZDPMS Support
---------------------

This project is intended to provide support for the monitoring and control
logic embedded in some Enermax power supplies (notably the Enermax DigiFanless
550W). The initial development includes a user-space proof-of-concept utility
based on the cross-platform libhidapi library; future plans include the
creation of a Linux kernel driver to tie the ZDPMS support into the "hwmon"
subsystem used by lm-sensors, plus potentially support for other Enermax
products.


1. What Works

The userland zdpms-config utility is apparently able to query and correctly
interpret all DC rail sensors and temperature sensors on the DigiFanless 550W,
plus the AC input voltage and the model-number string. It can also configure
the 12V rails for single-rail or dual-rail operation with the correct
command-line options.


2. What Doesn't Work

I haven't yet figured out how to query the power factor, apparent power usage
(VA), or actual power usage (watts) on the AC input side. Theoretically, with
all the other sensor information I have, I should only need two of these
readings to extrapolate the third.

I'm also hammering on a Linux kernel driver, but the ZDPMS controller
apparently doesn't advertise all the needed HID report descriptors, and it
will take some hackery to work around this. libhidapi apparently avoids this
problem by not relying on report descriptor enumeration.
